It is widely agreed that one of the most basic needs of man is shelter and in time past man has experienced with different material in order to meet with his housing needs. In modern day history, the use of cement along with sand and gravel as come to be accepted as one of the best construction raw material because they provide durability, firmness and can withstand harsh weather conditions though other materials like steel and glass are also used.

The ever increasing deficit in housing supply in Nigeria which is estimated at over sixteen million {16,000,000} units and the need for the construction of other important infrastructure if the country is to meet up with the vision 20:2020 project of becoming amongst the top 20 economies in the world by 2020 continues to drive the need to sand, an essential construction raw material and the need for the use of modern equipment in the production of sand, in order to meet with demands.

Dredging is simply digging of mud, sand, gravel, pebbles, rocks and other deposit from the bottom of the creek, lagoon sand waterways using a vessel equipped for such purpose called a ‘DREDGER’’, such dug up materials depending on the type could be used for reclamation of swampy terrain, building and construction works.

Sharps sand and gravel can be mine using a dredger to reclaim vast expanse of swampy land and stock piled for sales. Sand dredging is vital for human habit and survival, industrial and social development, and for meeting the consumption need of our rapidly growing population.

Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. The composition of sand is highly variable, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz.

Though there are no reliable figures on the annual production in Nigeria, it is generally agreed that there has been an increased in production in order to meet up with increasing demands .In Nigeria and mostly in the oil and gas industry where they are used to make waterways more navigatable, Dredgers are required in commercial sand production.

Dredging activities produces lots of sand which are required in construction and other important activities. A dredge is a device for scraping or sucking the seabed, used for dredging. A dredger is a ship or boat equipped with a dredge.

If you live in a coastal area or are considering purchasing waterfront property, marine construction is something you should take advantage of. Marine construction focuses on anything built along the shoreline. These structures help to prevent damage to the property located near the water.

Common structures for this type of construction include bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, and revetments. If you are in need of marine construction services at your waterfront property, our experts at Fitzpatricks Limited will help you determine your concerns and needs.

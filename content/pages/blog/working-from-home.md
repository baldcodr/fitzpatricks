Dredging provides numerous benefits for shipping, construction, and other projects.  The advantages of dredging are:

**Widening and Deepening:** Dredging can be a critical process for the commercial shipping industry. Removing sediment can maintain the appropriate width and depth for enabling the safe, unobstructed passage of cargo vessels carrying oil, raw materials, and other essential commodities.  

**Waterway Project Preparation:** Dredging is a critical underwater excavation step in many waterway construction projects such as bridges, docks, piers and underwater tunnels.  

**Land Reclamation Projects:** Sediment removal is sometimes used as a source of materials for land-building projects. The liberated sediment can then be dried out and transported to a new location where additional land is required for building and other purposes.

Dredging also has numerous environmental benefits.  The environmental benefits are:  
**Environmental Remediation:** Sediment removal can help to restore a shoreline or beachfront to its original condition by reversing the effects of soil erosion.  

**Cleanup Applications:** Dredging can clean up a waterway after a toxic material spill or via the removal of trash, debris, decaying vegetation, sludge or other materials that can contaminate water and soil.  

**Preserving Aquatic Life:** Dredging can produce a healthier aquatic eco-system that can result in a more suitable habitat for fish and other wildlife. It can also be used for trash and debris removal to keep the waterways clean.  

**General Pollutant Removal:** Water bodies located near urban areas and industrial complexes can quickly become a receptacle for various pollutants. Sediment removal can prevent the accumulation of pollutants and keep the waterway clean and healthy.  

**Remediation of Eutrophied Water Bodies:** Eutrophication is an excessive amount of nutrients in a water body typically caused by water runoff from the surrounding land. Eutrophication can lead to an overabundance of plant growth that results in oxygen deprivation and can cause the death of aquatic wildlife. In some cases, dredging may be the most viable remediation option when eutrophication occurs.

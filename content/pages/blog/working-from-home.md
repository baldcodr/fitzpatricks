Dredging provides numerous benefits for shipping, construction, and other projects.  The advantages of dredging are:

Widening and Deepening: Dredging can be a critical process for the commercial shipping industry. Removing sediment can maintain the appropriate width and depth for enabling the safe, unobstructed passage of cargo vessels carrying oil, raw materials, and other essential commodities.
Waterway Project Preparation: Dredging is a critical underwater excavation step in many waterway construction projects such as bridges, docks, piers and underwater tunnels.
Land Reclamation Projects: Sediment removal is sometimes used as a source of materials for land-building projects. The liberated sediment can then be dried out and transported to a new location where additional land is required for building and other purposes.

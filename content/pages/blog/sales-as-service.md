As dredging consultants, we provide advice, knowledge and input on all aspects of the dredging process. These services are always delivered with economic, social and environmental benefits as the primary targets.

Fitzpatricks facilitates the development of ‘capital’ and ‘maintenance’ dredging operations. This includes project design, development, licencing & permitting applications, site management and environmental monitoring.

Generally a dredging process involves much more than just the dredging activity alone, therefore the range of services is equally extensive. With our international experience, Fitzpatricks as dredging consultants, provide an insight into a multitude of solutions.

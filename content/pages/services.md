<p>The general terrain of the Lagos and Niger Delta area of Nigeria is largely comprised of wetlands, yet these areas support massive population densities.

would exist within our area of activity. Fitzpatrick’s Limited is
however dedicated to striking a balance between the commercial opportunities and the responsible utilization of these scarce resources. It is thus our over riding interest that we practice and encourage industry players to subscribe to the dictates of genuine environmental safe guards as prescribed by the government.	</p>
